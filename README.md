Fosol.Diagnostics Library
=========================
Fosol.Diagnostics is a .NET 4.5 C# logging library.  It has a familiar initial impression to the Microsoft's System.Diagnostics namespace, although it offers a more intuitive configuration.  A number of key features within the library have been extracted and placed within the Fosol.Common library so that they can be used independantly (i.e. Fosol.Common.Parsers.ElementParser).
